## 📊 Customer Churn Analysis with Python and Machine Learning
## 📁 Project Overview;
This project aims to analyze and predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. By leveraging data from a telecom company, we identify the key factors contributing to customer churn and build predictive models to reduce it.

# 🔍 Objectives:
Understand the key drivers of customer churn.

Preprocess and explore the dataset.

Build and evaluate multiple machine learning models.

Identify the most important features contributing to churn.

Save and deploy the trained model for future predictions.

# 🧰 Tech Stack:
Python 3.8+

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, xgboost

Modeling:Linear Regression ,Logistic Regression,Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost

Visualization: Seaborn, Matplotlib
